# Root Bracketing Solvers

This sample illustrates the use of the root bracketing solvers for solving equations in one variable using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to use root bracketing solvers to find solutions to nonlinear equations 
in one variable using Numerics.NET.

Root bracketing solvers are numerical algorithms that find solutions to equations of the form f(x)=0 
by repeatedly narrowing down an interval known to contain a root. The sample shows three different 
methods:

- The Bisection method, which simply halves the interval at each step
- The Regula Falsi (False Position) method, which uses linear interpolation but can be slow to 
  converge in some cases
- The Dekker-Brent method, which combines the reliability of bisection with faster convergence
  techniques

The sample demonstrates how to:
- Set up and configure different root bracketing solvers
- Specify the target function to solve
- Control convergence criteria and iteration limits
- Handle the results and check solution status
- Access error estimates and iteration counts

Examples use simple trigonometric functions to illustrate the behavior and relative performance of 
each method. The code shows how to handle both well-behaved and more challenging cases.
