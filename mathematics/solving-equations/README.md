# Solving Equations

This folder contains the following projects:
- [Newton-Raphson Equation Solver](newton-equation-solver/) shows the use of the NewtonRaphsonSolver class for solving equations in one variable and related functions for numerical differentiation.
- [Nonlinear Systems](nonlinear-systems/) shows the use of the NewtonRaphsonSystemSolver and DoglegSystemSolver classes for solving systems of nonlinear equations.
- [Root Bracketing Solvers](root-bracketing-solvers/) shows the use of the root bracketing solvers for solving equations in one variable.
