# Newton-Raphson Equation Solver

This sample illustrates the use of the NewtonRaphsonSolver class for solving equations in one variable and related functions for numerical differentiation using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to use the NewtonRaphsonSolver class to find roots of nonlinear equations in
one variable using the Newton-Raphson method.

The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative technique that uses both a function and its derivative to find
roots (zeros) of equations. Starting from an initial guess, it generates progressively better
approximations to the root. The sample shows:

* How to create and configure a NewtonRaphsonSolver object
* Using the solver with functions that have analytical derivatives (like Math.Sin)
* Using numerical differentiation when analytical derivatives aren't available
* How to control the iteration process by setting parameters like:
  - Maximum number of iterations
  - Convergence criteria
  - Relative and absolute tolerances
* How to interpret results and error estimates
* Using the convenient FindZero extension method for simple cases

The sample includes practical examples using both trigonometric functions and special functions (Bessel
functions), demonstrating the solver's versatility with different types of equations.
