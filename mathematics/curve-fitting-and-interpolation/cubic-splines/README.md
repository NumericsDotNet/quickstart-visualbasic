# Cubic Splines

This sample illustrates using natural and clamped cubic splines for interpolation using classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to create and work with cubic splines in Numerics.NET. Cubic splines 
provide smooth interpolation through a set of data points by constructing piecewise cubic polynomials.

The sample shows several key aspects of working with splines:
- Creating natural splines with zero second derivatives at endpoints
- Creating clamped splines with specified slopes at endpoints
- Creating Akima splines that minimize oscillations
- Creating Hermite splines with specified derivatives at each point
- Accessing and modifying spline parameters
- Evaluating splines and their derivatives at arbitrary points
- Finding tangent lines and computing definite integrals
- Working with the piecewise nature of spline curves

Through practical code examples, you'll learn how to choose appropriate spline types for different
interpolation needs and how to use the key methods and properties of the CubicSpline class. The sample
includes examples of both basic usage and more advanced features like derivative calculation and
integration.
