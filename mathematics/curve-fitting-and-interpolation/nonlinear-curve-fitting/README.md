# Nonlinear Curve Fitting

This sample illustrates nonlinear least squares curve fitting of predefined and user-defined curves using the NonlinearCurveFitter class using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform nonlinear curve fitting using the NonlinearCurveFitter class 
in Numerics.NET.

The sample shows two main approaches to nonlinear curve fitting:

1. Using a predefined curve type (FourParameterLogisticCurve) to fit a dose-response curve to data 
that includes measurement errors. This demonstrates how to:
   - Set up the curve fitter with x/y data points and measurement errors
   - Convert errors to weights for weighted least squares fitting
   - Obtain fit parameters and their standard deviations
   - Access diagnostic information about the fitting process

2. Creating and fitting a custom nonlinear curve using both manual implementation and automatic 
differentiation:
   - Shows how to create a custom curve class by inheriting from NonlinearCurve
   - Demonstrates implementing value, slope and partial derivative calculations
   - Shows how to use automatic differentiation as an alternative to manual implementation
   - Uses the NIST Statistical Reference Dataset MGH10 to validate the implementation
   - Demonstrates both unweighted and weighted fitting using built-in weight functions

The sample includes extensive error handling and provides examples of accessing diagnostic 
information such as residuals, iteration counts, and function evaluations.
