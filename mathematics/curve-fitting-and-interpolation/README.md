# Curve Fitting and Interpolation

This folder contains the following projects:
- [Cubic Splines](cubic-splines/) shows using natural and clamped cubic splines for interpolation using classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra namespace.
- [Linear Curve Fitting](linear-curve-fitting/) shows how to fit linear combinations of curves to data using the LinearCurveFitter class and other classes in the Numerics.NET.Curves namespace.
- [Nonlinear Curve Fitting](nonlinear-curve-fitting/) shows nonlinear least squares curve fitting of predefined and user-defined curves using the NonlinearCurveFitter class.
- [Piecewise Curves](piecewise-curves/) shows working with piecewise constant and piecewise linear curves using classes from the Numerics.NET.Curves namespace.
