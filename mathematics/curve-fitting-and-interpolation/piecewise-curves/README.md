# Piecewise Curves

This sample illustrates working with piecewise constant and piecewise linear curves using classes from the Numerics.NET.Curves namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to work with piecewise constant and piecewise linear curves in 
Numerics.NET. These curves are useful for interpolating discrete data points where the function behavior 
between points is either constant or linear.

The sample covers:
- Creating piecewise constant curves using different constructor overloads
- Creating piecewise linear curves using different constructor overloads 
- Accessing and modifying curve parameters
- Evaluating curves at specific points using ValueAt()
- Computing slopes and derivatives
- Finding tangent lines at points
- Computing definite integrals

The code demonstrates practical usage of the PiecewiseConstantCurve and PiecewiseLinearCurve classes from
the Numerics.NET.Curves namespace. It shows how to construct curves from arrays of x,y coordinates or
Point objects, access curve parameters, evaluate curve values and derivatives, and compute integrals.

This sample is particularly useful for developers working with discrete data that requires interpolation,
such as in signal processing, data analysis, or scientific computing applications where data points need
to be connected using either constant or linear segments.
