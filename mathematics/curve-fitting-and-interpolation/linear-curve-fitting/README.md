# Linear Curve Fitting

This sample illustrates how to fit linear combinations of curves to data using the LinearCurveFitter class and other classes in the Numerics.NET.Curves namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform linear least squares curve fitting using the LinearCurveFitter 
class in Numerics.NET.

The sample shows two practical applications of linear curve fitting. First, it demonstrates polynomial 
fitting using data from the NIST Statistical Reference Datasets library for calibrating load cells. The 
sample fits a quadratic polynomial to deflection measurements, showing both unweighted and weighted 
least squares approaches.

The second example shows how to fit arbitrary linear combinations of functions. It uses experimental 
data for the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of copper. The theoretical model expresses 
conductance as a combination of inverse temperature and temperature squared terms. The sample 
demonstrates how to:

- Create custom basis functions for fitting
- Transform data to achieve linearity
- Use the GeneralFunctionBasis class for arbitrary function combinations
- Extract and interpret fitted parameters and their uncertainties
- Calculate residuals to assess fit quality

The code includes examples of working with vectors, setting up fitting problems, handling weights, and
interpreting statistical results. It serves as a practical introduction to linear least squares methods
in Numerics.NET.
