# Differential Equations

This sample illustrates integrating systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using Numerics.NET's 
ODE solver capabilities.

The sample illustrates three different ODE solvers:
- The classic 4th order Runge-Kutta method with fixed step size
- The Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (RKF45) with adaptive step size control
- The CVODE solver from the SUNDIALS suite, which can efficiently handle both non-stiff and stiff 
  problems

The sample uses these solvers on two test problems:
1. The Lorenz attractor - a nonlinear system of three coupled equations that exhibits chaotic 
   behavior. This demonstrates basic usage of the solvers on a non-stiff system.
2. A flame expansion problem - a single nonlinear equation that becomes increasingly stiff as the 
   initial condition approaches zero. This shows how CVODE's implicit methods can efficiently handle 
   stiff problems where explicit methods struggle.

The code shows how to:
- Set up and configure different ODE solvers
- Define systems of differential equations using delegate functions
- Provide Jacobian matrices for stiff problems
- Control integration accuracy through step size and tolerance settings
- Access solver statistics and intermediate results
