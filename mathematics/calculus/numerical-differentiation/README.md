# Numerical Differentiation

This sample illustrates how to approximate the derivative of a function using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform numerical differentiation using Numerics.NET. It shows how to 
calculate derivatives of functions using different numerical methods including central, forward, and 
backward differences.

The sample covers:
- Using central differences for standard numerical differentiation
- Handling edge cases with forward and backward differences when central differences aren't suitable
- Error estimation in numerical differentiation results
- Creating derivative functions as delegates that can be passed to other methods
- Working with functions that have domain restrictions or discontinuities

The code demonstrates practical scenarios where each differentiation method is most appropriate, 
including functions undefined on part of their domain and functions with discontinuities. It also shows 
how to obtain error estimates for the calculated derivatives, which is crucial for assessing the 
accuracy of the numerical results.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
