# Advanced Integration

This sample illustrates more advanced numerical integration using the AdaptiveIntegrator class using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates advanced numerical integration techniques using the AdaptiveIntegrator class 
from Numerics.NET. It shows how to handle challenging integration problems including infinite 
intervals and functions with singularities.

The sample covers several key aspects of advanced numerical integration:

- Integration over infinite intervals using adaptive Gauss-Kronrod quadrature rules
- Handling functions with singularities at interval endpoints through extrapolation techniques
- Managing internal singularities and discontinuities by specifying their locations
- Controlling integration accuracy through absolute and relative tolerance settings
- Monitoring convergence and performance through iteration counts and error estimates

Each integration scenario is demonstrated with practical examples, including the integration of 
exponential functions over infinite intervals and functions with logarithmic singularities. The code 
shows how to configure the integrator, execute the integration, and interpret the results.

The sample also illustrates performance benefits of using appropriate numerical techniques for 
challenging integrals, demonstrating how adaptive methods can achieve high accuracy with fewer 
function evaluations compared to simpler approaches.
