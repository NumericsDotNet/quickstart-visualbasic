# Calculus

This folder contains the following projects:
- [Advanced Integration](advanced-integration/) shows more advanced numerical integration using the AdaptiveIntegrator class.
- [Basic Integration](basic-integration/) shows the basic numerical integration classes.
- [Differential Equations](differential-equations/) shows integrating systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE's).
- [Higher Dimensional Numerical Integration](nd-integration/) shows numerical integration of functions in higher dimensions using classes in the Numerics.NET.Calculus namespace.
- [Numerical Differentiation](numerical-differentiation/) shows how to approximate the derivative of a function.
