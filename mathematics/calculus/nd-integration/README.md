# Higher Dimensional Numerical Integration

This sample illustrates numerical integration of functions in higher dimensions using classes in the Numerics.NET.Calculus namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform numerical integration of functions in two dimensions using 
Numerics.NET's integration capabilities.

The sample shows several key aspects of multi-dimensional integration:

- Using the `AdaptiveIntegrator2D` class for efficient integration over rectangular regions
- Working with the `Repeated1DIntegrator2D` class that uses repeated one-dimensional integration
- Setting up integrand functions using delegates
- Integrating over arbitrary non-rectangular regions by specifying boundary functions
- Monitoring integration progress through properties like Status, EstimatedError, and function 
  evaluation counts
- Comparing numerical results with known analytical solutions

The example includes integration of several test functions including:
- A rational function: 4/(1 + 2x + 2y) over the unit square
- A trigonometric function: (π²/4)sin(πx)sin(πy) over the unit square
- A polynomial function: x²y² over the unit disk

For each integration, the sample demonstrates how to set up the problem, execute the integration, 
and analyze the results including error estimates and computational effort required.
