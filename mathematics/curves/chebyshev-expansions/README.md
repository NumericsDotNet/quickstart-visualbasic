# Chebyshev Series

This sample illustrates the basic use of the ChebyshevSeries class  using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to work with Chebyshev series for polynomial approximation in 
Numerics.NET. Chebyshev polynomials provide a robust alternative basis for representing and 
manipulating polynomials with superior numerical stability.

The sample covers:
- Creating Chebyshev series with explicit coefficients over specified intervals
- Generating Chebyshev approximations of arbitrary functions
- Examining the coefficients and error characteristics of Chebyshev approximations
- Performing least squares fitting using Chebyshev basis functions

The example specifically shows approximating the cosine function and demonstrates the high accuracy
achievable with relatively low-degree Chebyshev expansions. It includes error analysis at the
zeros of higher-degree Chebyshev polynomials and illustrates how to work with both interpolation
and least squares fitting approaches.

This approach is particularly valuable when high numerical precision is required or when working
with higher-degree polynomial approximations where traditional polynomial bases may become
unstable.
