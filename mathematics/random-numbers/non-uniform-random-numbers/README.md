# Non-Uniform Random Numbers

This sample illustrates how to generate random numbers from a non-uniform distribution using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to generate random numbers from non-uniform probability 
distributions using Numerics.NET.

The sample specifically illustrates the relationship between exponential and Poisson distributions in
modeling events over time. It uses an exponential distribution to generate times between events, and
then compares the resulting frequency of events per time unit with the theoretical Poisson 
distribution.

The code shows how to:
- Create and configure specific probability distributions (Exponential and Poisson)
- Use the MersenneTwister random number generator
- Generate random samples from a probability distribution
- Collect and analyze statistical data from the generated samples
- Compare empirical results with theoretical expectations

This practical example helps understand both the mechanics of generating non-uniform random numbers
and how different probability distributions relate to each other in modeling real-world phenomena.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
