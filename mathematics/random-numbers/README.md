# Random numbers and Quasi-Random Sequences

This folder contains the following projects:
- [Non-Uniform Random Numbers](non-uniform-random-numbers/) shows how to generate random numbers from a non-uniform distribution.
- [Quasi-Random Sequences](quasi-random/) shows how to generate quasi-random sequences like Faur√© and Sobol sequences using classes in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.Random namespace.
- [Random Number Generators](random-number-generators/) shows how to use specialized random number generator classes in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.Random namespace.
