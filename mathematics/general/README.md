# General

This folder contains the following projects:
- [BigNumbers](big-numbers/) shows the basic use of the arbitrary precision classes: BigInteger, BigRational, BigFloat.
- [Complex Numbers](complex-numbers/) shows how to work with complex numbers using the DoubleComplex structure.
- [Elementary Functions](elementary-functions/) shows how to use additional elementary functions.
- [FFT/Fourier Transforms](fourier-transforms/) shows how to compute the forward and inverse Fourier transform of a real or complex signal using classes in the Numerics.NET.SignalProcessing namespace.
- [Generic Algorithms](generic-algorithms/) shows how to write algorithms that are generic over the numerical type of the arguments.
- [Prime Numbers](prime-numbers/) shows working with prime numbers and the IntegerMath class in the Numerics.NET namespace.
