# Prime Numbers

This sample illustrates working with prime numbers and the IntegerMath class in the Numerics.NET namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to work with prime numbers using the IntegerMath class from 
Numerics.NET. The sample shows essential operations for working with prime numbers and factorization.

The sample illustrates several key capabilities:
- Factoring integers into their prime components, including handling of repeated factors
- Testing numbers for primality using the IsPrime method
- Finding the next prime number greater than a given value
- Finding the previous prime number less than a given value
- Working with large numbers up to 48 bits in length

The code demonstrates practical applications like:
- Decomposing composite numbers into their prime factors with multiplicity
- Verifying whether large numbers are prime
- Generating sequences of consecutive prime numbers both forward and backward
- Handling edge cases with large integers and repeated factors

All operations use efficient algorithms optimized for performance while maintaining numerical accuracy.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- Required NuGet packages: Numerics.NET.Core, Version 9.1.0

### Running the Sample

#### In Visual Studio
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio
2. Restore NuGet packages: Right-click on the solution → Restore NuGet Packages
3. Update the trial key in the code:
