# Complex Numbers

This sample illustrates how to work with complex numbers using the DoubleComplex structure using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform calculations with complex numbers in C# using 
Numerics.NET.

The sample shows how to:
* Create complex numbers using different constructors and methods
* Access the real and imaginary parts, as well as polar coordinates (magnitude and phase)
* Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
* Calculate complex conjugates
* Compute elementary functions of complex numbers including:
  - Exponential and logarithmic functions
  - Trigonometric functions and their inverses  
  - Hyperbolic functions and their inverses
* Work with complex roots of unity and polar form
* Use complex numbers with arbitrary precision types like Quad

The code includes detailed comments explaining each operation and demonstrates proper formatting
of complex numbers for display. It serves as a comprehensive introduction to complex arithmetic
in C#, suitable for both learning and reference.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
