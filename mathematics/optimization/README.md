# Optimization

This folder contains the following projects:
- [Linear Programming](linear-programming/) shows solving linear programming (LP) problems using classes in the Numerics.NET.Optimization.LinearProgramming namespace.
- [Mixed Integer Programming](mixed-integer-programming/) shows how to solve mixed integer programming by solving Sudoku puzzles using the linear programming solver.
- [Nonlinear Programming](nonlinear-programming/) shows solving nonlinear programs (optimization problems with linear or nonlinear constraints) using the NonlinearProgram and related classes.
- [Optimization In One Dimension](optimization-in-1d/) shows the use of the Brent and Golden Section optimizer classes in the Numerics.NET.Optimization namespace for one-dimensional optimization.
- [Optimization In Multiple Dimensions](optimization-in-nd/) shows the use of the multi-dimensional optimizer classes in the Numerics.NET.Optimization namespace for optimization in multiple dimensions.
- [Quadratic Programming](quadratic-programming/) shows how to solve optimization problems a quadratic objective function and linear constraints using classes in the Numerics.NET.Optimization namespace.
