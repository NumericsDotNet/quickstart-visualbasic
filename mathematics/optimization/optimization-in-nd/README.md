# Optimization In Multiple Dimensions

This sample illustrates the use of the multi-dimensional optimizer classes in the Numerics.NET.Optimization namespace for optimization in multiple dimensions using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to use various optimization algorithms in Numerics.NET to find minima 
of multidimensional functions.

The sample shows how to use several different optimization methods:

* BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) method - A quasi-Newton method that approximates the 
  Hessian matrix to find minima efficiently. The sample demonstrates both manual gradient 
  specification and automatic differentiation.

* Conjugate Gradient methods - Including Fletcher-Reeves and Polak-Ribiere variants, which are
  particularly effective for large-scale problems.

* Powell's method - A derivative-free method that can work when gradients are unavailable or
  difficult to compute.

* Nelder-Mead simplex method - A robust method that can handle discontinuous functions, though
  it converges more slowly than gradient-based methods.

The sample uses the classic Rosenbrock function as a test case, showing how to specify objective
functions, gradients, and initial guesses. It demonstrates both manual gradient implementation and
the use of automatic differentiation. For each method, it shows how to configure the optimizer
and interpret the results, including solution quality and performance metrics.
