# Optimization In One Dimension

This sample illustrates the use of the Brent and Golden Section optimizer classes in the Numerics.NET.Optimization namespace for one-dimensional optimization using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to find the minimum or maximum of a function in one dimension using 
Numerics.NET's optimization capabilities.

The sample shows two different optimization algorithms:

- Brent's algorithm - A sophisticated and efficient method that combines golden section search with 
  parabolic interpolation. It is the recommended method for most one-dimensional optimization problems.
  The sample demonstrates how to:
  - Create and configure a BrentOptimizer
  - Find an interval containing an extremum using FindBracket
  - Locate the precise minimum or maximum
  - Access results and error estimates

- Golden Section Search - A simpler but slower algorithm based on the golden ratio. The sample shows 
  how to use the GoldenSectionOptimizer class to find extrema.

Both methods are demonstrated on two test functions:
1. A cubic polynomial f(x) = x� - 2x - 5
2. An exponential function f(x) = 1/exp(x� - 0.7x + 0.2)

The sample illustrates proper error handling, accessing optimization results, and comparing estimated 
versus actual errors. It also shows how to use lambda expressions for defining objective functions in 
C# 3.0 and later.
