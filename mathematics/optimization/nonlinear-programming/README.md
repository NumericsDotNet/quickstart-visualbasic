# Nonlinear Programming

This sample illustrates solving nonlinear programs (optimization problems with linear or nonlinear constraints) using the NonlinearProgram and related classes using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to solve nonlinear optimization problems with constraints using the 
NonlinearProgram class in Numerics.NET.

The sample presents three different approaches to solving nonlinear programming problems:

1. A chemical equilibrium problem with linear constraints, demonstrating how to:
   - Define an objective function involving logarithms
   - Set up linear constraints using sparse matrices
   - Handle variable bounds
   - Solve a real-world optimization problem

2. A mathematical optimization problem with nonlinear constraints, showing:
   - How to build a nonlinear program from scratch
   - Adding nonlinear constraints with manually specified gradients
   - Adding constraints where gradients are approximated numerically
   - Setting initial values for the optimization

3. The same mathematical problem solved using automatic differentiation, illustrating:
   - How to simplify implementation by using symbolic functions
   - Letting the system automatically compute required gradients
   - Comparing results with the manual approach

Each approach is fully documented with code and explanatory comments, making it easy to understand
the different ways of setting up and solving nonlinear programming problems.
