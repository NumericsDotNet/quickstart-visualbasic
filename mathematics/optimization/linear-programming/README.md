# Linear Programming

This sample illustrates solving linear programming (LP) problems using classes in the Numerics.NET.Optimization.LinearProgramming namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to solve linear programming problems using Numerics.NET's 
optimization capabilities. Linear programming is a method for achieving the best outcome in a 
mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.

The sample illustrates three different approaches to creating and solving linear programs:

1. Matrix-based approach - Shows how to construct a linear program by specifying the cost vector, 
   constraint coefficients matrix, and right-hand side vector directly. This is useful when working 
   with problems that are naturally expressed in matrix form.

2. Incremental construction - Demonstrates building a linear program step by step by adding variables 
   and constraints individually. This approach provides more clarity and is often more maintainable 
   for smaller problems.

3. MPS file input - Shows how to read a linear program from an MPS format file, which is an industry 
   standard format for representing linear and integer programming problems.

For each approach, the sample shows how to:
- Set up the linear program
- Solve it using the Revised Simplex algorithm
- Retrieve both the primal and dual solutions
- Access the optimal objective value

The sample includes proper error handling and demonstrates best practices for working with the 
LinearProgram class.
