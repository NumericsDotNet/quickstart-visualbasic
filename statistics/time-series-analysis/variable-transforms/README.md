# Variable Transformations

This sample illustrates how to perform a range of transformations on statistical data using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform various transformations on time series data using financial market 
data as an example. It shows how to calculate common technical analysis indicators and statistical 
measures.

The sample loads Microsoft stock price data and shows how to:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations on numerical variables
- Calculate lagged values and cumulative statistics
- Compute various types of moving averages (simple, exponential, weighted)
- Calculate indicators of change including absolute change and percent change
- Apply the Box-Cox transform for normalizing data
- Implement common technical analysis indicators including:
  - Accumulation Distribution
  - Chaikin Oscillator 
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The code demonstrates how to combine basic transformations to create more complex indicators, while
showing proper usage of the Numerics.NET Data Analysis library's variable transformation capabilities.
Error handling and computational efficiency are emphasized throughout the examples.
