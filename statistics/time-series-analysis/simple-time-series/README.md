# Simple Time Series

This sample illustrates how to perform simple operations on time series data using classes in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.TimeSeriesAnalysis namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to work with time series data using Numerics.NET. It shows basic operations
for loading, analyzing and transforming financial market data.

The sample loads historical stock price data from a CSV file into a time series data frame. It
demonstrates several key operations:

- Loading time series data from CSV files
- Accessing individual variables (columns) like Open, High, Low, Close prices and Volume
- Calculating basic statistics like mean prices
- Selecting data for specific time ranges
- Resampling time series to different frequencies (daily to monthly)
- Using different aggregation functions for each variable when resampling
  - First price of period for Open
  - Last price of period for Close  
  - Maximum price for High
  - Minimum price for Low
  - Sum for Volume

The code provides a practical example of handling financial market data, but the techniques shown can
be applied to any time-stamped data series.
