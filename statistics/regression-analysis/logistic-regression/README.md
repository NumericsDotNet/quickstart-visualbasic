# Logistic Regression

This sample illustrates how to use the LogisticRegressionModel class to create logistic regression models using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform binary and multinomial logistic regression analysis using the
LogisticRegressionModel class in Numerics.NET.

The sample shows two key examples:

1. A binary logistic regression model analyzing factors that determine low birth weight, using data
from Baystate Medical Center. The example demonstrates:
   - Loading data from fixed-width text files
   - Creating and fitting logistic regression models using both explicit variable lists and formulas
   - Handling categorical predictors
   - Interpreting model parameters and statistics
   - Performing likelihood ratio tests to compare nested models

2. A multinomial logistic regression example analyzing duration data with three response levels. This
example shows:
   - Working with categorical response variables
   - Specifying multinomial models
   - Interpreting results with multiple response levels
   - Testing global model significance

The sample includes detailed output of parameter estimates, standard errors, test statistics, and
p-values, demonstrating how to access and interpret the full range of model diagnostics available in
Numerics.NET's logistic regression implementation.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
