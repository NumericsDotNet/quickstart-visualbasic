# Regression Analysis

This folder contains the following projects:
- [Generalized Linear Models](generalized-linear-models/) shows how to use the GeneralizedLinearModel class to compute probit, Poisson and similar regression models.
- [Logistic Regression](logistic-regression/) shows how to use the LogisticRegressionModel class to create logistic regression models.
- [Multiple Linear Regression](multiple-regression/) shows how to use the LinearRegressionModel class to perform a multiple linear regression.
- [Polynomial Regression](polynomial-regression/) shows how to fit data to polynomials using the PolynomialRegressionModel class.
- [Simple Regression](simple-regression/) shows how to perform a simple linear regression using the SimpleRegressionModel class.
