# Polynomial Regression

This sample illustrates how to fit data to polynomials using the PolynomialRegressionModel class using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform polynomial regression analysis using the 
PolynomialRegressionModel class in Numerics.NET.

The sample uses real-world calibration data from the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology's Statistical Reference Datasets library. Specifically, it works with the 'Pontius' 
dataset containing load cell calibration measurements, where deflection is modeled as a function 
of applied load.

The sample shows how to:
- Create and fit a polynomial regression model
- Access and interpret the regression parameters and their statistical properties
- Calculate confidence intervals for the parameters
- Obtain model quality metrics like R-squared and F-statistics
- Generate an ANOVA table for the regression analysis

The code includes detailed comments explaining each step and demonstrates proper error handling 
and statistical interpretation of the results. While the calculations may differ slightly from 
NIST's published results due to numerical precision differences, the sample illustrates the 
practical application of polynomial regression for scientific data analysis.
