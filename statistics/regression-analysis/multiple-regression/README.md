# Multiple Linear Regression

This sample illustrates how to use the LinearRegressionModel class to perform a multiple linear regression using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform multiple linear regression analysis using the 
LinearRegressionModel class in Numerics.NET.

The sample uses a dataset containing test scores of 200 high school students to build a regression model 
predicting science scores based on math, reading, and social studies scores along with gender. It shows:

- How to load data from a CSV file into a DataFrame
- Creating regression models using both explicit variable lists and formula notation
- Fitting the model and accessing regression parameters
- Getting parameter estimates, standard errors, t-statistics and p-values
- Calculating confidence intervals for parameters
- Accessing model statistics like R-squared and F-statistics
- Generating ANOVA tables and model summaries
- Working with model parameters both by index and by name

The sample demonstrates both basic model building and more advanced statistical analysis techniques,
making it useful for both beginners and those needing more sophisticated regression analysis.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
