# Discrete Distributions

This sample illustrates how to use the classes that represent discrete probability distributions in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.Distributions namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to work with discrete probability distributions in Numerics.NET, 
using the binomial distribution as a primary example.

The sample shows:
- How to construct discrete probability distributions with specified parameters
- How to access basic statistical properties like mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis
- How to calculate probability values using the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative 
  distribution function (CDF)
- How to generate random variates from the distribution using various sampling methods
- How to generate expected histograms for visualizing the distribution

The code uses the binomial distribution to illustrate these concepts, but the same principles apply to all
discrete distributions in Numerics.NET, including Bernoulli, geometric, hypergeometric, Poisson and other
distributions. The sample provides practical examples of common probability calculations and demonstrates
proper usage of the distribution classes.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- Required NuGet packages: Numerics.NET.Core, Version 9.1.0

### Running the Sample

#### In Visual Studio
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio
