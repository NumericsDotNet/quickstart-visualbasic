- [Mean Tests](mean-tests/) shows how to use various tests for the mean of one or more sanples using classes in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.Tests namespace.
- [Non-Parametric Tests](non-parametric-tests/) shows how to perform non-parametric tests like the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and the Kruskal-Wallis test.
