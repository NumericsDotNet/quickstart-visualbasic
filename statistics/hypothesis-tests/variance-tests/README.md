# Variance Tests

This sample illustrates how to perform hypothesis tests involving the standard deviation or variance using classes in our .NET statistical library using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform statistical hypothesis tests involving variances and 
standard deviations using Numerics.NET.

The sample works with test scores from two groups of students to illustrate two key variance-related 
tests:

1. A one-sample chi-square test to determine if a group's variance is greater than a specific value
2. A two-sample F-test to compare the variances between two groups

The code shows how to:
- Create numerical variables from test score data
- Calculate basic statistics like mean and standard deviation
- Perform a one-sample chi-square test with configurable significance levels
- Generate confidence intervals for variance estimates
- Compare variances between two groups using the F-test
- Interpret test results including test statistics, p-values, and hypothesis rejection decisions

The sample includes examples of setting different significance levels and obtaining corresponding 
confidence intervals, demonstrating the flexibility of the testing framework. All results are clearly
formatted and displayed with appropriate precision.
