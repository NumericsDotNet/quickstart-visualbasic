# Non-Parametric Tests

This sample illustrates how to perform non-parametric tests like the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and the Kruskal-Wallis test using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests using 
Numerics.NET. Non-parametric tests make fewer assumptions about the underlying data distributions 
compared to their parametric counterparts.

The sample shows three common non-parametric tests:

- The Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) rank sum test compares two independent samples to determine if they 
  come from the same distribution. The example uses real data from a study of oyster DNA and protein 
  variation.

- The Kruskal-Wallis test extends the Mann-Whitney test to three or more groups. The sample 
  demonstrates this using investment fund growth data from the NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook.

- The runs test checks for randomness in a sequence by analyzing the pattern of runs (consecutive 
  values) in the data. The example uses a sequence of binary outcomes to illustrate this test.

For each test, the sample shows how to:
- Create the test object with different data input formats
- Access the test statistic and p-value
- Make decisions using different significance levels
- Interpret the results

The code includes detailed comments explaining each step and the statistical concepts involved.
