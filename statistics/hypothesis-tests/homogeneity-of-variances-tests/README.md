# Homogeneity Of Variances Tests

This sample illustrates how to test a collection of variables for equal variances using classes in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.Tests namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to test whether multiple groups of data have equal variances using
both Bartlett's test and Levene's test implemented in Numerics.NET.

The sample uses a practical example of quality control in manufacturing, analyzing measurements 
of gear diameters from 10 different production batches. It shows how to:

- Set up data for homogeneity of variance tests
- Perform Bartlett's test for equal variances
- Perform Levene's test using different measures of location (mean, median, trimmed mean)
- Interpret test results including test statistics, p-values and critical values
- Compare the characteristics of both tests

The example illustrates an important application in quality control and ANOVA, where equal 
variances across groups is a key assumption. It demonstrates both the faster but more 
restrictive Bartlett's test and the more robust but computationally intensive Levene's test.
The sample includes detailed comments explaining the advantages and limitations of each approach.
