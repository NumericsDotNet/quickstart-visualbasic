# One-Way Anova

This sample illustrates how to use the OneWayAnovaModel class to perform a one-way analysis of variance using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the 
OneWayAnovaModel class in Numerics.NET.

The sample analyzes a marketing dataset examining the effect of package color on product sales 
across 12 stores. The data includes sales figures for packages in three colors (red, blue, and 
green). Using one-way ANOVA, the sample shows how to:

- Create a DataFrame from a collection of anonymous objects containing the sales data
- Construct and fit a OneWayAnovaModel using both direct variable specification and formula syntax
- Verify the balance of the experimental design
- Generate and display a classic ANOVA table
- Access group means and other statistics for each color group (treatment level)
- Calculate overall summary statistics like the grand mean

The code demonstrates proper model construction, checking model assumptions, and extracting both 
detailed and summary statistics from the analysis. This example is particularly relevant for 
researchers and analysts conducting experiments with a single categorical factor.
