# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This sample illustrates how to perform a Principal Component Analysis using classes in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.Multivariate namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a dataset using the 
Numerics.NET Statistics library.

The sample loads data from a text file containing depression study measurements and performs the 
following operations:

* Loads and prepares the data from a delimited text file
* Creates and fits a PCA model to the data
* Examines the eigenvalues and variance contributions of each principal component
* Shows how to determine the number of components needed to explain a given proportion of variance
* Displays the component vectors themselves
* Calculates and displays component scores
* Demonstrates how to use the components to predict/reconstruct the original data

The sample shows key PCA concepts including variance proportions, cumulative variance explained, 
component vectors, and scores. It illustrates how to interpret PCA results and use them for 
dimensionality reduction by selecting components that explain a target proportion of variance.

The code uses real-world depression study data to make the example concrete and practical. It 
shows common PCA workflow steps from data loading through analysis and prediction.
