# Cluster Analysis

This sample illustrates how to use the classes in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.Multivariate namespace to perform hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform cluster analysis using both hierarchical and K-means 
clustering methods in C#. It shows how to analyze multivariate data to discover natural groupings 
within the data.

The sample uses a real-world dataset of company financial metrics to demonstrate:

- How to perform hierarchical cluster analysis, including:
  - Standardizing variables using Z-scores
  - Selecting linkage methods and distance measures
  - Creating cluster partitions
  - Working with dendrograms
  - Accessing cluster memberships and ordering

- How to perform K-means clustering, including:
  - Initializing the model with a specified number of clusters
  - Standardizing variables
  - Accessing cluster assignments and distances
  - Computing cluster statistics
  - Working with cluster centers and inter-cluster distances
  
The sample includes detailed comments explaining each step and demonstrates best practices for working
with both clustering methods.
