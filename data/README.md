# Data Folder

This folder contains data files used by the sample projects in the **Numerics.NET QuickStart Samples** repository.

These datasets are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the Numerics.NET library, including data analysis, statistical computation, and machine learning tasks.

## 📁 Contents

Files in this folder may include:
- `.csv` files: tabular datasets used in data analysis and statistics samples
- `.txt` files: plain text data for processing or transformation
- `.dta` files: files containing data sets in Stata format
- `.rda` files: R data files for statistical analysis

## 📌 Usage Notes
- All sample projects reference these files using relative paths.
- Do not rename or move these files unless you also update the paths in the corresponding sample code.

## 📥 Adding New Data
If you are contributing new samples that require additional datasets:
1. Place the data file in this folder.
2. Ensure the file name is descriptive.
3. Include a brief description as a comment or in the relevant sample's README.
4. Make sure the data is freely redistributable or provide proper attribution if required.
