# Manipulating Columns

This sample illustrates how to transform and manipulate the columns of a data frame using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform various transformations and manipulations on data frame columns 
using Numerics.NET.

The sample shows common data wrangling operations including:
- Adding and removing columns in a data frame
- Renaming columns individually and using patterns
- Transforming column data using mathematical functions
- Working with multiple columns simultaneously
- Handling missing values by replacing them with group means
- Comparing row-based vs column-based operations for performance

The code uses a sample data frame with a DateTime index and random values to illustrate these
operations. It demonstrates both simple transformations like adding/removing columns as well as more
complex operations like grouping and aggregation. The sample includes examples of both efficient
column-based operations and less efficient but sometimes necessary row-based operations.

Throughout the sample, various DataFrame methods are demonstrated including AddColumn, RemoveColumn,
MapAndAppend, MapAndInsertAfter, and others. The sample also shows how to work with missing values
and perform group-based calculations.
