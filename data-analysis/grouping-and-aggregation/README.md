# Grouping and Aggregation

This sample illustrates how to group data and how to compute aggregates over groups and entire datasets. using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform grouping operations and compute aggregate statistics on 
datasets using Numerics.NET.

The sample uses the classic Titanic dataset to illustrate various grouping and aggregation 
techniques. It covers:

- Computing basic statistics like mean, count and standard deviation across entire datasets
- Creating custom aggregation functions for specialized calculations
- Grouping data by categorical variables and computing group-wise statistics
- Working with different types of windows including:
  - Moving (rolling) windows for time series analysis
  - Expanding windows that grow over time
  - Fixed-width time windows
- Resampling time series data to different frequencies
- Creating pivot tables for cross-tabulation analysis

The sample shows both simple aggregations on vectors and matrices as well as more complex 
operations on data frames. It demonstrates how to work with datetime indexes and time-based 
groupings, which are essential for time series analysis. The code includes examples of computing 
survival rates by passenger class in the Titanic dataset using different approaches, showing the 
flexibility of the grouping and aggregation capabilities in Numerics.NET.
