# Histograms

This sample illustrates how to create histograms using the Histogram class in the Numerics.NET.DataAnalysis namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to create and work with histograms using the Histogram class in 
Numerics.NET.

The sample shows several different ways to create histograms:
- Creating histograms with evenly spaced bins by specifying bounds and bin count
- Creating histograms with explicitly specified bin boundaries
- Creating histograms using Index objects to define bins
- Creating histograms for categorical data

It demonstrates key histogram operations including:
- Adding data to histograms using the Tabulate method
- Incrementing individual bins
- Accessing bin information like bounds and counts
- Finding which bin contains a specific value
- Iterating through bins and their values
- Working with both numerical and categorical data

The sample uses a practical example of analyzing test scores to illustrate these concepts. It shows how
to create different binning strategies and how to work with the resulting histogram data structures.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
