# Vector Operations

This sample illustrates how to perform operations on Vector objects, including construction, element access, arithmetic operations using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates the fundamental operations available for working with vector objects in 
Numerics.NET. It shows how to perform common mathematical operations on vectors efficiently and elegantly.

The sample covers:
- Basic vector arithmetic including addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication
- Computing vector norms (1-norm, 2-norm, infinity norm)
- Calculating dot products between vectors
- Finding maximum and minimum elements and their indices
- Applying mathematical functions to vectors using Map operations
- In-place operations for better performance
- Different ways to construct and manipulate vectors

Each operation is demonstrated with clear examples and shows both operator syntax and equivalent method
calls. The sample illustrates how to chain operations efficiently and how to use both static and
instance methods for vector manipulation. Special attention is paid to performance considerations,
such as when to use in-place operations versus creating new vector instances.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
