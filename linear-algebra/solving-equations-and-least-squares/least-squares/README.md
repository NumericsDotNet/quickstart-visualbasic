# Least Squares

This sample illustrates how to solve least squares problems using classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to solve least squares problems using the LeastSquaresSolver class in 
Numerics.NET. Least squares problems are fundamental in data analysis and numerical computing, where you 
need to find the best-fitting solution to an overdetermined system of equations.

The sample shows several approaches to solving least squares problems:
- Using the LeastSquaresSolver class with both QR decomposition and normal equations methods
- Direct solution using matrix operations to form and solve the normal equations
- Working with both vector and matrix right-hand sides

Key concepts covered include:
- Creating and initializing matrices and vectors
- Configuring and using the LeastSquaresSolver
- Accessing solution information like predictions and residuals
- Understanding different solution methods and their tradeoffs
- Working with normal equations directly

The sample includes detailed comments explaining each step and provides practical examples of common least
squares operations. It serves as a foundation for applications in curve fitting, regression analysis, and
other areas where least squares solutions are needed.
