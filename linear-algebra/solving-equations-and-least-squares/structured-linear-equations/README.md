# Structured Linear Equations

This sample illustrates how to solve systems of simultaneous linear equations that have special structure using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to solve systems of linear equations when the coefficient 
matrix has special structure - specifically triangular or symmetric matrices. These special 
structures allow for more efficient solution methods compared to general matrices.

The sample shows:
- Creating and working with triangular matrices
- Solving triangular systems of equations using the Solve method
- Creating and working with symmetric matrices 
- Solving symmetric systems of equations
- Using the Cholesky decomposition for positive definite symmetric matrices
- Handling multiple right-hand sides
- Computing matrix properties like determinants, inverses and condition numbers
- Error handling for indefinite matrices
- Performance considerations when solving multiple systems

Code examples demonstrate proper usage of the relevant Numerics.NET classes and methods, including
error checking and handling special cases. The sample includes examples of both single right-hand
side vectors and multiple right-hand side matrices.
