# Solving Equations and Least Squares

This folder contains the following projects:
- [Iterative Sparse Solvers](iterative-sparse-solvers/) shows the use of iterative sparse solvers and preconditioners for efficiently solving large, sparse systems of linear equations.
- [Least Squares](least-squares/) shows how to solve least squares problems using classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra namespace.
- [Linear Equations](linear-equations/) shows how to solve systems of simultaneous linear equations.
- [Structured Linear Equations](structured-linear-equations/) shows how to solve systems of simultaneous linear equations that have special structure.
