# Linear Equations

This sample illustrates how to solve systems of simultaneous linear equations using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to solve systems of linear equations using Numerics.NET. It shows both 
basic solution methods and more advanced techniques using LU decomposition.

The sample illustrates several key concepts:
- Creating and populating matrices with data
- Solving a system of equations with a single right-hand side using the Solve method
- Solving systems with multiple right-hand sides efficiently
- Checking matrix properties like singularity and condition number
- Computing matrix inverses and determinants
- Using LU decomposition for improved performance with multiple operations
- Accessing the L and U factors of the decomposition

Through clear examples and detailed output, you'll learn the recommended approaches for solving
linear systems and understanding their numerical properties. The sample also demonstrates best
practices for handling both single and multiple right-hand sides, and shows how to evaluate the
quality of solutions through condition number estimation.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
