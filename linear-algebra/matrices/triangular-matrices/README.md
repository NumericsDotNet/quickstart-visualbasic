# Triangular Matrices

This sample illustrates how to work efficiently with upper or lower triangular or trapezoidal matrices using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to work with triangular matrices in Numerics.NET. Triangular 
matrices are special matrices where all elements either above the diagonal (lower triangular) or below 
the diagonal (upper triangular) are zero.

The sample covers:
- Creating upper and lower triangular matrices through various constructors
- Working with unit diagonal triangular matrices (matrices with all 1's on the diagonal)
- Extracting triangular parts from dense matrices
- Accessing matrix properties like IsLowerTriangular and IsUpperTriangular
- Handling matrix elements and the restrictions on modifying zero elements
- Working with rows and columns of triangular matrices

The code illustrates proper error handling when attempting to modify read-only elements and shows how 
to efficiently work with these specialized matrix types. This is particularly useful in numerical 
algorithms where triangular matrices arise naturally, such as in LU decomposition or backward 
substitution.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- Required NuGet packages: Numerics.NET.Core, Version 9.1.0

### Running the Sample

#### In Visual Studio
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio
