# Matrix-Vector Operations

This sample illustrates how to perform operations that involve both matrices and vectors using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform common operations involving both matrices and vectors using 
Numerics.NET.

The sample covers several key areas of matrix and vector operations:
- Basic matrix arithmetic including addition, subtraction and matrix multiplication
- Matrix-vector products, both left multiplication (Mv) and right multiplication (vM)
- In-place operations combining matrices and vectors like adding or subtracting matrix-vector products
- Computing matrix norms including one-norm, infinity norm and Frobenius norm
- Matrix operations like computing the trace and transpose

The code shows how to create matrices and vectors, perform calculations efficiently, and access 
properties of the results. It demonstrates proper usage of operator overloading and specialized 
methods for combined operations. The sample includes detailed comments explaining each operation and 
its mathematical significance.


## Getting Started
