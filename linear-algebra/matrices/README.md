# Matrices

This folder contains the following projects:
- [Accessing Matrix Elements](accessing-matrix-components/) shows different ways of iterating through the rows and columns of a matrix using classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra namespace.
- [Band Matrices](band-matrices/) shows how to work with the BandMatrix class.
- [Basic Matrices](basic-matrices/) shows the basic use of the Matrix class for working with matrices.
- [Matrix Decompositions](matrix-decompositions/) shows how compute various decompositions of a matrix using classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra namespace.
- [Matrix-Vector Operations](matrix-vector-operations/) shows how to perform operations that involve both matrices and vectors.
- [Sparse Matrices](sparse-matrices/) shows using sparse vectors and matrices using the classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra.Sparse namespace.
- [Symmetric Matrices](symmetric-matrices/) shows how to work efficiently with symmetric matrices.
- [Triangular Matrices](triangular-matrices/) shows how to work efficiently with upper or lower triangular or trapezoidal matrices.
