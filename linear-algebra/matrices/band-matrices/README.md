# Band Matrices

This sample illustrates how to work with the BandMatrix class using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to work with band matrices in Numerics.NET using the BandMatrix class.

Band matrices are matrices whose elements are nonzero only in a diagonal band around the main 
diagonal. They appear frequently in scientific computing and numerical analysis, particularly when 
solving systems of linear equations that arise from finite difference methods.

The sample shows how to:
- Create different types of band matrices including general, upper/lower triangular, and symmetric
- Extract band matrices from existing matrices
- Access and modify band matrix elements efficiently
- Work with matrix properties and structural information
- Use specialized decompositions for band matrices including LU and Cholesky
- Solve linear systems involving band matrices
- Handle row and column views of band matrices

The code illustrates the memory-efficient storage scheme used for band matrices and demonstrates
how to properly allocate space for decompositions that require extra bandwidth.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
