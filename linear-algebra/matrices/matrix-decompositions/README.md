# Matrix Decompositions

This sample illustrates how compute various decompositions of a matrix using classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to compute and work with various matrix decompositions using the 
Numerics.NET library. Matrix decompositions are fundamental tools in linear algebra that break down
matrices into products of simpler matrices with special properties.

The sample covers four major matrix decompositions:

- LU Decomposition (A = PLU): Shows how to factor a matrix into a product of a permutation matrix
  (P), lower triangular matrix (L), and upper triangular matrix (U). Demonstrates solving linear
  systems and computing matrix inverses and determinants.

- QR Decomposition (A = QR): Illustrates factoring a matrix into a product of an orthogonal matrix
  (Q) and upper triangular matrix (R). Shows how to solve least squares problems for
  overdetermined systems.

- Singular Value Decomposition (A = USVᵀ): Demonstrates computing the SVD which factors a matrix
  into orthogonal matrices U and V and a diagonal matrix S containing singular values. Shows how
  to compute pseudoinverses and solve under/overdetermined systems.

- Cholesky Decomposition (A = LLᵀ): Shows how to factor a symmetric positive definite matrix into
  a product of a lower triangular matrix and its transpose. Demonstrates solving linear systems
  and computing matrix inverses.

The sample also includes eigenvalue decomposition of symmetric matrices, showing how to compute
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For each decomposition, it demonstrates practical applications like
solving linear systems, computing matrix properties, and working with the factors.
